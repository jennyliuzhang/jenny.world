    <div class="paper">
      <p>Of course I like to learn about myself. Please, tell me more, I’m mostly looking for advice. I ask God, the stars, Buzzfeed, Myers-Briggs, the therapist who holds up the mirror. But not a real mirror, though I wish it were. More like a frame. She holds up a frame, made of words and questions like “where were your priorities a year ago?” and “how often do you think about her? And how about him?” She’s looking for me. Me too. Now that it’s a hunting game, I gather the shards of a reflection, saying yes and no and listing grievances that are only distant idiosyncrasies now. But I recite those stories anyway, because though they’re no longer true or the pit of my pit, how can I forget what I’ve been saying for so long in this endless rehearsal?</p>

      <p>An endless rehearsal is not my preferred philosophy about life, so I give up what I think my past is. When I give up the script for a second, when I stop reciting, I just am. It’s not easy. I am at a loss for words. So I smile or frown or sigh, depending on what feels most honest to the moment. I try to be honest with my face. She and I behold that face and whatever words it can say, or not say, in 45 minutes, and together we peel it off the air that hangs between where we sit, the intimacy of our contract, and let it float between us like a body of fresh work. There’s the spirit, we agree. The frame has something to hold, finally. When the game’s done, I thank her. Of course I like to learn about myself. We say goodbye and I take the bus back to my apartment, a permanent trip in this routine, on and after which I am back to reciting and reciting and reciting.</p>

      <p>There is a book of stories called The Vanishing Princess by Jenny Diski. It’s very fun. The first story in it is "The Origin of Cubism."</p>

      <p>"The Origin of Cubism" is about a princess who lived in a tower and spent all her time reading books. She had no awareness of the outside world. Her door had a lock, but it was uncertain if it actually worked. She had never tried to escape.</p>

      <p>One day, a soldier came to see her. He continued to visit her and bring her gifts. Another soldier also started to visit. He also brought her gifts, one of which was a mirror. When the soldiers were not around and the princess was alone, she would read her books, ponder her gifts, and look at herself in the mirror. She started to realize she existed.</p>

      <p>During a visit, the first soldier noticed the mirror. He told her to pose in front of it, and he started to trace and etch the outline of her face into the glass. On his next visit, the second soldier saw the etching on the mirror and added the outline of her eyes. The soldiers, on every visit, would see what had been added and etch another one of her features. Then, one day, the princess could no longer see herself in the mirror. Uncertain of who she was and whether she really existed, she disappeared. No one knew where she went.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>I am shrewd enough to know unoriginality when I see it, so I know I’m almost always derivative. I’m like the soldiers for trying to etch in glass some permanent portrait. And I am the princess, too, because I don’t know if I quite see myself in it, or maybe even at all.</p>

      <p>I'm writing a ten-page Spanish paper. There’s no prompt. I ask the professor what the point of the paper is. All you need to do is convince me, she says, that you have control of your own thoughts. Write for yourself. Not for me, or for a grade. Write for yourself. If you write for any other reason, you are regurgitating, you are saying things you don’t mean.</p>

      <p>I see. So I get to choose the argument that belongs to me. If I’m not in control, whatever argument I choose won’t belong to me. I have no reason to claim it, much less defend it.</p>

      <p>Yeah, she says. And if you do defend it, that’s not human. That’s the robot. The rubbish reciting. All wasted effort.</p>

      <p>I am shrewd enough to know waste when I see it. I’ve wasted so much. I find myself easily believing all the etchings of others. Somewhere underneath it all, though, I’m looking for what I have control of. The real reflection, the face of a spirit, the reality in everyone’s assumptions, and my own.</p>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>"The Cubists proposed that the sight of an object is the sum of many different views. The memory of an object is not constructed from one angle, as in perspective, but from many angles selected by your sight and movement. Cubist painting, paradoxically abstract in form, was an attempt at a more realistic way of seeing."</p>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>I recently decided to give away a lot of my clothes. I had friends and strangers come into my apartment and sift through a giant pile on my floor, picking out the pieces they identify with. Of course they like to learn about themselves. They thank me and leave. People are looking to be found, and the permanence—polyester, non-degradable foreverness—of clothes can be donned like etchings in a mirror and souvenirs of the landscape inside.</p>

      <p>To be honest, it all feels a bit rapacious. Just the fact that they’re in my room, looking in my mirrors. It’s a dressing room. I let people in one by one and I close the door and tell them to just let me know when they’ve picked out what they want to take. It’s a private affair. They’re reciting my old scripts, hunting through my waste.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>I stopped believing in coincidences a while ago, though I haven’t admitted it publicly and still probably won’t. I can’t help it. Everything is connected because I hunt for the metaphors. I am the pattern-finder of the world, trying to understand how lost I am, why I am lost, how I got lost in the first place. This is the macrocosm of every movie about a man with a missing memory, so of course I’m looking for what’s familiar. That’s all I am ever doing. And you too, don’t lie.</p>

      <p>I think about the people I love like the night sky. I see familiar patterns and constellations, and I love them. Sometimes they aren’t, but so often they’re the ones I recognize about myself. I love them and I make my etchings of them. They do the same to me. We’re the etchings of the stars we notice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>You tell stories about yourself, you see the cause and effect, you see the poetry. In your mother’s eyes, the never-ending acceptance, the only one you’ve known, the one you struggle to give yourself, so you look for it everywhere else, hunting. Your personal statement for college, your cover letter, the reasons you give during lunch dates. Or you remember the songs, after all this time, singing them in the car, lulling a harder life back to an ignorance of earlier revolutions. I hope you know we only remember the things that are real to us. We forget the traces of a journey. The days that pass without eye contact are the days of robotic dissonance, straying from that spirit. I hope you know we only keep the things we pay attention to.</p>
      <p>So consider who and what catches your eye. How can I look at the stars and not see the Big Dipper? How can I not see the mirror? Listen to the laughs you remember, the voices that you etch. Etch good ones. You can’t help but keep that pattern of a journey, so choose the right one to keep.</p>
      <p>I am not a vanishing princess. I am a pattern-finder, a collector, an etcher. I have a choice every day. I am, and I am in great company!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>"The Cubists saw the limitations of perspective as an obstacle to progress. As the image was drawn from a fixed position, the result was frozen, like a snapshot, but the Cubists wanted to introduce the idea of “relativity”—how the artist perceived and selected elements from the subject, fusing both their observations and memories into the one concentrated image."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>You don’t need to find answers for it. This is you. You can laugh and sing and dance and dive and kiss and love and feel like no one else. You might also cry and panic, but you’re also funny and stylish. You have your faults, there are reasons for them I’m sure. You long for them to be found, talking like a hunter, trying to remember how you got here. You hope to be understood, seen, you hope your searchers haven’t given up and gone home. But you don’t need to find the answers. There is no answer, no pattern. Let your body love what it loves, despair when it feels desperate. Do good, do what makes today and only today worth it. Don’t dwell, be brave. You’re so brave. Turning calamity into calm is not easy. Recognize it, walk alongside it, and be gentle to it.</p>
      <p>The key, I tell you, is a strong spirit. You ask me how to buy one. I laugh. I’m still earning mine, paying attention. For humans, it’s a layaway thing, I say. For how long? For life, I say. Maybe longer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>I worry I am the eulogy for waste. I spend too much money investing in things I realize I only liked one thing about, and too much time on some people for the same reason. There are etchings I keep and scripts I recite that are no longer my spirit.</p>
      <p>I empty the frame of false shards. I constantly replace old ones. I’m still choosing. I’m never done, or good.</p>
      <p>And I want so much to be good! I want to be only good patterns, but sometimes I forget what good means. It might happen slow, I entertain the constellations of others, I breathe their encouragement, I abide and I slowly become their princess. I become the sky for their rite, the robot that believes in their sun, only to realize I was floating light years away from my own, some forgettable waste, in space, straying, quite in the dark.</p>
      <p>Other times, I think I have control because I am close to the story of the constellations I’ve noticed about myself for so long. Then there’s a star, some messy helix I can’t understand, it might happen so quick, some implosion, lines in a portrait so jagged I can’t bear to peel it away from my own eruption. But then there it is. Suspended, like a gasp, in conversation between you and me, the waste of a constellational debris. The waste of what I will never forget, but would like to, and you too, please, the broken pattern you should turn your face away from, the undeserving reflection, too much light shed. Too much poignant attention paid.</p>
      <p>So this is the difference between clothes I wear to fit in, and clothes I chose to wear but then regret. Somehow both don’t fit a pattern.</p>
      <p>But then, no matter what, it is over. It will always be over at some point. I move on. And when I leave them, or they leave me, something vanishes when I look in the mirror. Not in a bad way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>"Cubism is an analysis of vision and of its representation, and it is challenging. As a society we seem to believe that all art ought to be easily understandable or at least beautiful. That's the part I find confusing."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paper">
      <p>So, the layaway thing, I ask. When will I know I have it? You’ll know, you say. You might notice it first in the concrete you walk on, the posture of the trees. You’ll earn it in the most natural scripts, the conversations you make, the lyrics you are slowly learning to understand. Your friendships will feel whole, and so will every assignment, every errand. You’ll have control, and you’ll certainly see it in the mirror. You’ll feel full. And real. And good. And you will know because you’ll never—never—let anyone take it away from you. They won’t be able to.</p>
