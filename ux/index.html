				<h2>Jenny's</h2>
				<h1 class="title">UX Design<br>Playbook</h1>

				<h2>Manifesto</h2>
				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I’m a student in the <a href="http://iovine-young.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC Iovine and Young Academy</a> studying how business and technology intersect with design. My favorite activities are to design brand strategies and product mockups, write essays and stories, conduct interviews, and teach others how to do these things, too.</p>

				<h3>Why UX?</h3>
				<p>UX design excites me because every thing in our lives is a user experience. Mobile apps, classrooms, restaurants, and even entire cities all can tell persuasive narratives. As a designer, technologist, and literature junkie minoring in English, I’m confident in my abilities to craft product narratives&mdash;good user experiences&mdash;in any of these mediums.</p>

				<h3>A Playbook?</h3>
				<p>This playbook is a document of my process. I will show you how I follow UX principles and integrate my own insights from asking questions, my own projects and background, and my love for a good story.</p>

			<h1>Why Adobe?</h1>
			<img src="img/banner-work.jpg" alt="">

			<div class="wrap">
				<h4>Besides my passion for Adobe products since age 11 (all above graphics were made in Photoshop CS2 circa 2008-2011 and can be found on my <a href="http://jennaiiix3.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>. I also wrote my college personal essay about Illustrator's UI and why I think in layers)...</h4>
				<h5>I want Adobe's UX to be second nature.</h5>
				<h4>I grew up in the Adobe suite. The UI is so natural to me: I'm just as comfortable sketching in Illustrator as I am on paper. <span class="highlight">I want to see a world where Adobe's UX is so familiar and widespread that everyone is capable of digital creation.</span></h4>
				<p>This past year, I’m the lead for a team of 9 doing creative consulting work for the Adobe Education department. This project is part of a class called Discerning and Making, in which we conduct market research, boil down painpoint insights, and develop a product for an industry.</p>
				<p>Through my research, I've learned that many people prefer pen and paper to sketch. That's important to me, because I prefer sketching in Illustrator. My insight: people are comfortable with what they're exposed to young, and what they grew familiar with. I was lucky enough to grow up with Microsoft Paint and early Photoshop.</p>
				<p>Right now, the on-ramping process is difficult. I've taught and watched too many people struggle with Bezier bars. There are so many possible user experiences, but none of them make sense naturally. I can use Adobe products to make just about anything now, but when someone is just getting started, they don't know what they don't know.</p>
				<p>I love to create experiences that teach users through its process a new concept. Familiarizing new interfaces. My experiences exploring VR, web design, and even social media techniques have taught me that there's a <span class="highlight">natural grain</span> to everything.</p>
				<p>Over the last three years, I’ve explored several industries from food entrepreneurship to working on an app for managing internet for a market age 45+. I’ve honed these skills and interacted with many teams to tell the best stories possible. Listening and conversing across disciplines is my strength.</p>
				<h4 style="width:90%; font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold;">Adobe products have equipped me to be the digital ninja I'm aspiring to be today! Everyone should have this opportunity.</h4>
