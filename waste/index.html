      <p>One time after work this summer, I was sad, so I walked into the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco. There was a book called <em>The Vanishing Princess</em> by Jenny Diski. I read the first story, "The Origin of Cubism."</p>

      <p>"The Origin of Cubism" is about a princess who lived in a tower and spent all her time reading books. She had no awareness of the outside world. Her door had a lock, but it was uncertain if it actually worked. She had never even tried to escape.</p>

      <p>One day, a soldier came to see her. He continued to visit her and bring her gifts. Another soldier also started to visit. He also brought her gifts, one of which was a mirror. When the soldiers were not around and the princess was alone, she would read her books, ponder her gifts, and look at herself in the mirror. She started to realize she existed.</p>

      <p>During a visit, the first soldier noticed the mirror. He told her to pose in front of it, and he started to trace and etch the outline of her face into the glass. On his next visit, the second soldier saw the etching on the mirror and added the outline of her eyes. The soldiers, on every visit, would see what had been added and etch another feature of the princess. Then, one day, she could no longer see herself in the mirror. Uncertain of who she was and whether she really existed, she disappeared. No one knew where she went.</p>

      <p>I will never forget this story. I think I should have bought the entire book because I liked this so much, but I didn't. I was afraid to commit.</p>
